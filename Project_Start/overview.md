# Cost of Travel Index

## What It Is

The Cost of Travel Index is a monthly economic indicator that tracks how much it costs for a couple to take a typical three-day weekend trip across the United States. Similar to the Consumer Price Index that tracks everyday living costs, our index follows travel expenses over time to help destinations understand pricing trends and their competitive position in the market.

## How It Works

Each month, we analyze millions of actual visitor transactions to calculate the cost of a standardized travel experience:

- **2 nights** of accommodations (Friday and Saturday)
- **6 meals** at restaurants (4 at breakfast/lunch prices, 2 at dinner prices)
- **2 days** of attractions and entertainment
- **1 day** of retail shopping

By tracking the same "basket of goods" every month, we can see how travel costs change over time and compare expenses across different destinations.

## What It Measures

The index provides insights at multiple levels:

- **National trends**: Overall changes in U.S. travel costs month-over-month and year-over-year
- **Regional comparisons**: How travel costs vary across major U.S. regions
- **State-level detail**: Individual state rankings and cost positioning
- **Seasonal patterns**: Peak vs. off-season pricing fluctuations

## Why It Matters

**For Destinations**: Understand your pricing position relative to competitors, identify value opportunities, and track how your costs compare to regional and national averages.

**For Travelers**: See which destinations offer the best value at different times of year and how costs are trending in your preferred travel locations.

**For the Industry**: Monitor overall market health, identify emerging trends, and understand how external factors (inflation, fuel costs, demand shifts) impact travel pricing.

## Key Features

- **Real transaction data**: Based on actual visitor spending, not surveys or estimates
- **Consistent methodology**: Same calculation method applied across all geographies and time periods
- **Quality controls**: Only includes destinations with sufficient data to ensure statistical reliability
- **Monthly updates**: Fresh data reflects current market conditions

## Coming Soon

Future enhancements will include county and city-level indices, indexed values relative to baseline periods, and cohort analysis tools to help destinations compare themselves to similar markets.
